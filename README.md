# 3D nonlinear wave resistance


## This code is not finished!

Things it needs:

 * update the hull mesh properly when the free surface changes
 * It's been 6 years since I worked on this.  I don't think it converged well before I had to stop work on it.  
 
 
 ## Two versions:
  * This one, I believe, implements the transom stern condition of Raven 1996.
  * Another version keeps the standard boundary conditions for a canoe body.
